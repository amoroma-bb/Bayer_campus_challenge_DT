# Bayer Digital Campus Challenge 2021
How digital will Bayer be in 2032?
Digitalization is taking place everywhere and affects all of us. At Bayer, we ask ourselves how we can capitalize on the opportunities that arise from digitalization. What effects do you think all these new digital technologies will have and how will Bayer change? And how can they be leveraged in the health business?

## Our toptic is Digital Therapeutics

How can we provide precision medicine – the holy grail of modern medicine – to patients? Well, “radical patient-centricity” could be one answer. But what are the channels for getting in touch with patients, engaging with them and providing them with services that they are willing to accept, while also improving their health and well-being? There are various options, with the default setting being patient-physician interaction. What if “The doctor will see you now (for a couple of minutes)” is not enough, and flips to become “The patient will see you now” (Eric Topol)? Are there digital solutions for improving patients’ health status? How can we include high-end medicine such as metabolomics, epigenomics and microbiomics in remote interaction of patients with “the healthcare system”? Is this possible in real-time? Which devices are eligible and accepted by patients and authorities? What does a perfect patient journey look like – and how does the data flow? How can we gain better insight if patients suffer from their illness? How can we increase patient engagement? What role does Bayer play in providing health solutions to patients? There are a lot of questions, and we are open to hearing your solutions!
